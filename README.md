# MicroPython-BME680-MQTT-Publisher

This repository contains a Python script designed for the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller running MicroPython. The script reads temperature, pressure, humidity, and gas data from a BME680 sensor and publishes it to an MQTT broker. The code ensures robust Wi-Fi connectivity with automatic reconnection, guaranteeing uninterrupted data transmission even if the network connection is temporarily lost.  Additionally, the script utilizes an LED to indicate successful data transmission and handles exceptions with retry attempts for reliable operation. Use this efficient script to seamlessly monitor environmental data for your IoT projects.
